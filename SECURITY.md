# Security policy

## Reporting an issue

At Chec we take security very seriously, and rapidly investigate any reports of security vulnerabilities. If you come across an issue, please let us
know via security@chec.io and we will get back to you promptly.

## Platform

All transactions and orders through the Chec Platform are safe and secure. We enforce industry standard 2048 bit SSL encryption on all
web connections.

Chec does not handle or store any credit card data. All payment gateway providers that we integrate with are PCI compliant.

Our infrastructure access is restricted on a need-to-know-basis to a select group of our engineering teams. This means that our support staff
may not always have direct access to your data.

We take regular backups of our databases, which are stored in a private, isolated location.
